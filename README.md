Bank OCR Kata
Reads in a file of digital read outs of account numbers.
What?

This is a digital read out of an account number:
    _  _     _  _  _  _  _ 
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _| 

=> 123456789

The program does additional processing to calculate a checksum,
and print out whether there is a scan error ("ILL") or a checksum error ("ERR")


To run the program:
`python bankOCR.py`
